title: "Environmental chemistry and sustainable management of coral reefs (field visit included) (OCEAN 7193)"
output: pdf_document

## Information

**Time**: to be arranged (Fall Semester)

**Lecturer**:  Huei-Ting (Tina) Lin

**Credits**: 3


## Description

This advanced course is designed to train graduate students and advanced undergraduate students to obtain knowledge about environmental chemistry, focusing on coral reef environmental chemistry. The students will become skillful to channel the most updated scientific research results with citizen scientists, e.g. residential volunteers. Through this course, we will search through the literature and to identify key parameters for coral reef environmental monitoring. Students will help to analyze samples collected by our collaborating citizen scientists, to interpret the data based on literature information, and to present the results to citizen scientists at the beach site at the end of the semester.

|      | Take-home question: In our bottle experiment, how will the alkalinity of the 500mL seawater sample change after the ~180 mL headspace CO2 is dissolved into the seawater and the seawater pH drops to make the methyl-red indicator turned red-orange?\   |
