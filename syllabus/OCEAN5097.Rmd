## Outline

The rapid decline of coral reefs around the world motivates research to better understand how these ecosystems will look tomorrow under climate change. This course will make an up-to-date review of the knowledge of reef organisms and ecosystems, and it will emphasize the contemporary factors of reef degradation affecting population dynamics. Elements supporting the resilience of these ecosystems will be introduced together with perspectives in terms of reef management. Overall, through the lectures, the students will be provided with an up-to-date understanding of the coral reef crisis and the immediate actions to take for the long-term conservation of these fragile ecosystems. Many examples will be based on reefs in Taiwan, and speakers may be invited to illustrate specific topics.


This course is an introduction to coral reefs and requires basic knowledge in marine life, biology, and ecology Few classes about coral physiology could be a bit more challenging, but overall a strong curiosity about coral reefs is the most important to enjoy this course.


## Objectives

+ Basic knowledge of reef organisms and coral ecosystems
