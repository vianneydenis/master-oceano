## Information

**Time**: Tuesday 13:20- 16:20

**Lecturers**: Vianney DENIS

**Credits**: 3 

## Reference

## Outline

The rapid decline of coral reefs around the world motivates research to better understand how this complex ecosystem will respond to future environmental changes. This course will review current knowledge on reef organisms and coral reef ecosystem, and will study the factors responsible for reef degradation. The basic elements to assess resilience of this ecosystem will be introduced. The students will learn how the knowledge and skills obtained through the lectures and practice work can be used for the management and the conservation of this fragile ecosystem.

This course requires only basic knowledge in marine ecology and biology.


## Objectives

+ Basic knowledge of reef organisms and coral ecosystem
+ Highlight current research priority in the context of global changes
+ Implication to reef management and conservation
