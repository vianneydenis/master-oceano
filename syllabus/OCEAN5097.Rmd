## Outline

The rapid decline of coral reefs around the world motivates studies to better understand how these complex ecosystems will respond to future environmental changes. This course will make an up-to-date review on the knowledge of reef organisms and ecosystems, and the factors responsible for reef degradation.  Information will further serve to understand the population dynamics and resilience abilities observed on reefs throughout the world with a perspective of conservation. Many examples will be based on the present reef conditions around Taiwan. According to their availability, speakers may be invited to illustrate a particular topic.


This course is an introduction to coral reefs and only requires basic knowledge in marine life, biology, and ecology Few classes about coral physiology could be a bit more challenging, but overall a strong curiosity about coral reefs is the most important to enjoy this course.


## Objectives

+ Basic knowledge of reef organisms and coral ecosystem
+ Highlight research priority in the context of global changes
+ Implication for reef management and conservation
