You must accumulate a minimum of 13 credits with these classes on the 24 credits you need to get your degree and aside from your thesis.\r\nGeneral Topics\r\nThose courses …\r\nEnglish Writing in Marine Sciences  (OCEAN 7168) - 3 credits\r\nDescription: this seminar course is designed to improve IONTU graduate students’ communication skills through writing in English. Students will utilize examples from the textbook, “Writing science: How to write papers that get cited and proposals that get funded” by Joshua Schimel. I will also share comments and revisions to scientific manuscripts that I collected over the years. The class starts by having students write a short Facebook post about their own research. Students will lean to expand their Facebook post into a one-page-long (800-850 words) article. Throughout the class, students will apply writing styles and techniques to edit their article, including ways to condense their article to only 300-350 word long. Each student is also required to read and analyze four published scientific papers of their own choice: one from a specialist journal written by a leader recognized in their field and a good writer, one typical paper from a specialized journal, one review paper, and one article from Nature or Science. The course will also incorporate peer-review practices; students will learn to recognize strengths and weakness of other students’ writing and give constructive comments to help improve each other’s writing. This is exactly what scientists do routinely: we review and give constructive comments to other’s manuscripts and proposals to help the science community grow. Students who have already had writing projects (such as an abstract, manuscript, or dissertation) can also practice analyzing and editing these drafts. We will also invite a guest lecturer from NTU’s Department of Foreign Languages and Literature or from NTNU’s English Department to talk about common English mistakes made by Taiwanese students and ways to improve this.\r\nInstructor: Huei-Ting (Tina) Lin\r\nScientific Communication in English  (OCEAN 7192) - 1 credit\r\nDescription: This course is designed to guide graduate students in communicating science professionally, with emphasis on training/practicing. More than half of the class hours will be on discussion and implementation of theories. The second half of the semester will focus on scientific/thesis writing skills. For IONTU students, this can serve as a supplemental course to each division’s seminar course. Course designed for students with background in science. Objective are: 1) Students get to practice scientific communication skills, including poster and oral presentations. (2) Students learn to apply the theories learnt in class or elsewhere. (3) Students get to practice scientific writing in English, as well as English skills in scientific correspondence and conferences.\r\nInstructor: Sze Ling HO\r\nPaper Reading (OCEAN 7005) - 1 credit\r\nDescription: the class aims to establish students’ ability to read, understand, present, question, and discuss research topics by presenting a textbook chapter and scientific paper. Students are required to preparing abstracts and 35-minute presentations. We expect the presentations to go beyond the textbook contents or selected papers to acquire additional materials when necessary.\r\nInstructor: Chih-Lin WEI, Hui-Yu WANG, Chih-Hao HSIEH; Chang-Feng DAI\r\nMarine Biology and Ecology\r\nThose courses …\r\nBiological Oceanography  (OCEAN 5051) - 3 credits\r\nDescription: This is a course intended for undergraduate and graduate students with knowledge of basic ecology. The focus will be on OCEANOGRAPHY, with investigation on interactive biological, chemical, and physical processes in the ocean. The purposes are to give an overview of biological ocean science (a wide rather than deep view) and to provide basic information and training for graduate research. The discussion will range from physical effects on the biology to biological effects on biogeochemical cycling; the spatial scale will range from individual organisms (e.g. viscosity and turbulences on plankton feeding and nutrient uptake) to ecosystem (e.g. remote sensing and circulation modeling); the organism will range from virus to whales.\r\nInstructor: Chih-Hao HSIEH, Fuh-Kwo SHIAH\r\nCoral Reef Ecosystem in a Changing World  (OCEAN 5097) - 3 credits\r\nDescription: The rapid decline of coral reefs around the world motivates research to better understand how these ecosystems will look tomorrow under climate change. This course will make an up-to-date review of the knowledge of reef organisms and ecosystems, and it will emphasize the contemporary factors of reef degradation affecting population dynamics. Elements supporting the resilience of these ecosystems will be introduced together with perspectives in terms of reef management. Overall, through the lectures, the students will be provided with an up-to-date understanding of the coral reef crisis and the immediate actions to take for the long-term conservation of these fragile ecosystems. Many examples will be based on reefs in Taiwan, and speakers may be invited to illustrate specific topics.\r\nInstructor: Vianney DENIS\r\nMarine Ecology (OCEAN 5002) - 3 credits\r\nDescription: This course offers a balanced, stimulating survey of marine ecology, introducing the key processes and systems from which the marine environment is formed, and the issues and challenges surrounding its future conservation. Students are expected to develop a broad understanding of various topics of marine ecology, be able to generate an in-depth review on a selected topic and give a presentation. The presentation topic and paper should be timely and include information from current SCIENTIFIC literature related to marine ecology. Students are encouraged to participate in the discussion on both lectures and presentations.\r\nInstructor: Chih-Lin WEI\r\nDeep Sea Ecology (OCEAN 5089) - 3 credits\r\nDescription: The vast deep sea is the largest living space on earth, and yet less than 5% of the seafloor has been explored in some details. In fact, we have better maps for the Moon, Mars, or even Venus due to our planet’s watery veil. The variety of habitats and the complex relationship with its inhabitants give rise to diverse communities, provide essential ecosystem functions and services, and maintains the ocean’s elemental cycling. However, climate changes and human activities on the seafloor have created unprecedented challenges and threats to the deep-sea ecosystems. These seemingly pristine environments have undergone major changes that out-pace our understanding of factors that drive the spatial and temporal patterns of the deep-sea ecosystems. This course will cover major topics in deep-sea ecology, including the physical environments and history, sampling techniques, adaptations of deep-sea organisms, community composition and functions, major habitats, and anthropogenic effects. By the end of this course, students are expected to be able to: 1) Describe the co-varying effects of physical environments on the adaptation of deep-sea organisms; 2) Describe the effects of depth and the co-varying factors on abundance, composition, diversity, and functions of deep-sea communities; 3) Compare and contrast various deep-sea habitats, the key processes, and associated communities; 4) Evaluate the potential impacts of human activities on the deep-sea ecosystem; 5) Read and understand scientific literature in deep-sea ecology, evaluate its findings and discuss its implications; 6) Synthesize and review a selected topic in deep-sea ecology, orally present and lead the discussion in its background, controversies, and future directions\r\nInstructor: Chih-Lin WEI\r\nField Work in Marine Biology (OCEAN 7090) - 1 credit\r\nDescription: This field course is designed for students in biological oceanography. Students will have the opportunity to participate in a 3-day research cruise onboard NTU’s R/V NOR1 to get hands-on experience on the hydrographic surveys and sampling of the planktonic and benthic communities. Students will also require to participate in hydrographic data and biological sample processing, data analysis, and complete a final report of their cruise activities.\r\nInstructor: Chih-Lin WEI, Jen-Chieh SHIAO, Chang-Feng DAI\r\nEvolutionary Biology and Population Genetics: Theory and Practice (OCEAN 5117) - 2 credits\r\nDescription: This is a basic and practical course intended for senior undergraduate and graduate students with already strong knowledge in basic biology. Students who are interested in any fields in biology are all welcome, because all of the biological phenomena are the product of the evolution. We will learn basic but important mathematical methods for analyzing evolutionary dynamics in biological systems. The course is designed for hand-on work with the empirical data. We will also use well-developed software but we do not need skills in computer programming for our practical work.\r\nMajor topics include:\r\nBasics in evolution\r\nNeutral evolution and natural selection\r\nClassical and modern population genetics\r\nPhylogeography\r\nInstructor: Wei-Jen CHEN\r\nResearch topic on molecular systematics of fishes (OCEAN 7170) - 2 credits\r\nDescription: The goal of systematic studies is to provide a meaningful interpretation of biodiversity and a comprehensive understating of mechanisms of evolution within the phylogenetic framework of the studying organisms. In this course, we will focus on the ray-finned fishes (especially those ones from marine habitats) that is the most diverse group of vertebrates and represents a source of valuable information for comparative biology as well as for medical science, yet many questions on their systematics (e.g., classification, taxonomy, evolution, biogeography, etc.) are still unanswered. To answer the questions, the molecular phylogenetic approach should primarily be used. The students involved in this course will learn how to use the molecular genetic data to conduct a research work for this perspective. Each student will be assigned for a work of a selected marine fish group and will be expected to write a manuscript about his/her conducted research that is publishable in a scientific journal.\r\nInstructor: Wei-Jen CHEN\r\nField Course in Coral Reef Ecology (OCEAN 7194) - 3 credits\r\nDescription: this course is designed to provide the student with a solid foundation in ecological concepts, techniques and experimental design in field research as applied to coral reef ecosystems. It consists of a one-week field-based research at a marine research station in Taiwan. To have attended Ocean 5097 is strongly recommended before joining this course. Alternatively, solid knowledge of coral reefs and the environmental challenges they are currently facing is requested. The course will begin with a general introduction of the coral reefs and how they are influenced by global and local factors. It will quickly narrow down to the context of Taiwan by introducing the local context: known diversity, past disturbances, and on-going research. The major reef biota will be discussed in terms of their ecological requirements, roles on the reef and their overall impact. Methods in ecological monitoring and sampling will be discussed and applied on the field and will serve as a baseline for a future long-term ecological assessment. Data analysis will consist of examining and comparing structure of benthic assemblages among sites and depths (basic knowledge of R software is recommended). Students are asked to provide a poster (electronic format) summarizing their work a maximum of one month after the last day on the field.\r\nInstructor: Vianney DENIS\r\nPopulation Ecology and Sustainable Fisheries Resources (OCEAN 5105) - 3 credits\r\nDescription: Understanding dynamics and fluctuations of natural fish populations requires a diverse set of skills. Through this course students will learn knowledge of fish biology and field and quantitative methodologies for exploring population dynamics of both freshwater and marine fishes. In addition, students will broaden understanding of fisheries and natural resource management (through lectures and text book readings), practice and develop critical thinking skills (through in-class discussions and a group presentation), and learn how to read and interpret the scientific literature in fish ecology and fisheries science (through discussing the primary literature). Ultimately, this course will provide knowledge and training on formulating research questions and tackling problems in management of fisheries and other natural resources in a changing world.\r\nInstructor: Hui-Yu WANG; Yi-Jay CHANG\r\nSpecial topics on Ichthyology (OCEAN 5067) - 2 credits\r\nDescription: This course provides advanced information on fishes.

The course materials are mainly based on published papers in international journals. For example, papers related to fish population dynamics, stock assessment, fishery management, statistical models, and computer simulations are the primary topics of this course. Selected students give a weekly PowerPoint presentation of a paper and lead a group discussion with the professor and other students.\r\nInstructor: Yi-Jay CHANG\r\nAdvanced Quantitative Methods in Fisheries Stock Assessment (Ocean 7178) - 3 credits\r\nDescription: This course introduces advanced quantitative methods in fisheries stock assessment, including decision analysis to evaluate alternative management actions, Bayesian state-space modelling, meta-analysis, and integrated analysis. The course draws examples from real fisheries in the world and provides student broad experience with various fishery data and fish biology. The goals of this course are to train the students to be familiar with methods in fish population dynamics and stock assessment and proficient in parameter estimation, as well as the uncertainty, of an exploited fish population, and evaluation of harvest restrictions for fisheries management problems by using various computer programs and tools.\r\nInstructor: Yi-Jay CHANG\r\nMarine Data Analysis\r\nBiological modeling  (OCEAN 5074) - 3 credits\r\nDescription: The course material is designed to be interdisciplinary, integrating biology, ecology, mathematics and environmental sciences. While the main course material is based on classic ecological modeling textbooks and articles, these analytic methods are applicable to multi-faceted research questions. The material builds from a single population and then extends to the ecosystem level, including species interaction, climate changes and disease as well as molecules interactions within cells. Regular modeling exercises are required (1 unit as practice). After equipped with modeling skills, students have to develop their own research questions and use modeling and data mining approaches to solve their questions. Instructors will guide students through the question-solving processes.\r\nInstructor: Chih-hao HSIEH; Hui-Yu WANG, Sheng-Feng SHEN\r\nComputer-Intensive Statistics in Ecology  (OCEAN 5052) - 3 credits\r\nDescription: This is an advanced course intended for senior undergraduate and graduate students with knowledge of basic statistics including random variables, analysis of variance, regression analysis, and rank-based non-parametric statistics. We will discuss several computer-intensive statistical methods. We will discuss the theory, assumption, and application of these methods in ecological problems. The course is designed for hand-on work. Students need to get familiar with at least one computer language to do the statistics. Most of work can be done with MatLab, but any other programming language will do equally well. Sometimes, we will use well-developed software when the computation is too complicated and beyond the basic level. There will be dedicated time every week for students to present their works and to discuss the application of these methods on real world problems.\r\nInstructor: Chih-hao HSIEH; Hui-Yu WANG; Yi-Jay CHANG\r\nEcological Modeling Seminar (Ocean 7152) - 2 credits\r\nDescription: A seminar course for presenting and discussing about research in ecology and quantitative analysis. Students are required to give 2 presentations and participate discussion in English.\r\nInstructor: Hui-Yu WANG; Chih-Hao HSIEH\r\nEcological Data Analysis in R (OCEAN 5089) - 3 credits\r\nDescription: this course is designed to teach the use of a programming language for the analysis of ecological data. The course will introduce the basics of R language, and will go through topics such as data manipulation, exploration and visualization. It will then present common approaches for data analysis introducing frequent statistical tests, linear models, clustering and ordination approaches applying to multivariate data. This course mainly targets students without prior understanding of R language and who want to get familiar with this free & open-source software environment. Students will also be introduced to GitHub and Rmarkdown that further improve the use of R. Students will require a laptop for sessions. Schedule is subject to changes according to student progress.\r\nInstructor: Vianney DENIS\r\nMarine Geology\r\nInvitation to Paleoceanography (OCEAN 5126) - 2 credits\r\nDescription: This course aims to introduce an interdisciplinary branch of science, known as paleoceanography (knowledge of ancient oceans), to students with no prior background. Ocean is an integral part of the Earth’s climate system, thus mechanistic understanding of how oceans change in the past will improve overall understanding of global climate change. The lecture contents are across disciplines, ranging from general oceanography, climate change, formation process of marine sediments, geochemical indicators used as proxies of past oceanic change, to the instruments used to generate these geochemical data. The course is suitable for oceanography / geoscience / Earth science / geography students who are curious about climate change, paleoceanography and paleoclimate. It is especially useful for students who plan to carry out graduate research in paleoceanography, either as introductory or refresher course. The course will adopt inquiry-based learning (student-led learning). Critical thinking questions will be provided to steer discussion. The goal of the course is to ensure that students can apply the knowledge and theories learnt in class and to link different topics across disciplines. Students will achieve basic understanding on how climate changes on Earth and especially the oceans can be reconstructed using marine sediments. The inquiry-based approach will train students in critical thinking, problem solving and independent learning – all of these skills are essential for a career in academia and industry. There will be plenty of opportunities for discussion and debate to train students’ communication skills. The interdisciplinary nature of climate science exposes students to various fields of study and approaches used, which helps to broaden their horizon beyond their major.\r\nInstructor: Sze Ling HO\r\nClimate and Ocean (OCEAN 5112) - 2 credits\r\nDescription: This is an introductory course on Earth’s climate, and its link to the ocean which covers 70% of the Earth’s surface. Emphasis is on climate changes since the past 50 Million years at different time-scales and how these changes can be inferred using different climate archives. Students will achieve basic understanding on how climate changes on Earth, as well as be exposed to unresolved issues in climate science. The latter will train students in critical thinking and debate, i.e. skills which will be especially helpful for students who are interested in graduate research. The interdisciplinary nature of climate science exposes students to various fields of study and approaches used, which helps to broaden their horizon beyond their major.\r\nInstructor: Sze Ling HO\r\nPaleoclimate Proxies in Marine Sediments (OCEAN 7185) - 2 credits\r\nDescription: This course is designed to guide graduate students in communicating science professionally, with emphasis on training/practicing. More than half of the class hours will be on discussion and implementation of theories. The second half of the semester will focus on scientific/thesis writing skills. For IONTU students, this can serve as a supplemental course to each division’s seminar course. Course designed for students with background in science. Objective are: 1) Students get to practice scientific communication skills, including poster and oral presentations. (2) Students learn to apply the theories learnt in class or elsewhere. (3) Students get to practice scientific writing in English, as well as English skills in scientific correspondence and conferences.\r\nInstructor: Sze Ling HO\r\nMarine Chemistry\r\nEnvironmental chemistry and sustainable management of coral reefs (field visit included)  (OCEAN 7193) - 3 credits\r\nDescription: This advanced course is designed to train graduate students and advanced undergraduate students to obtain knowledge about environmental chemistry, focusing on coral reef environmental chemistry. The students will become skillful to channel the most updated scientific research results with citizen scientists, e.g. residential volunteers. Through this course, we will search through the literature and to identify key parameters for coral reef environmental monitoring. Students will help to analyze samples collected by our collaborating citizen scientists, to interpret the data based on literature information, and to present the results to citizen scientists at the beach site at the end of the semester.\r\nInstructor: Huei-Ting (Tina) Lin\r\nOcean Physics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

How Long Does it Take?\r\nFinding a Topic\r\nYour Advisor and Your Committee\r\nSome other formal requirements\r\n\r\nWhat is Master’s thesis\r\nA master’s thesis is a piece of original scholarship written under the direction of a faculty advisor. A master’s thesis is similar to a doctoral dissertation, but it is generally shorter and more narrowly focused. As a rule of thumb, a master’s thesis should be publishable as a single article, though it might be longer than a typical article; a doctoral dissertation is generally equivalent to at least three articles. Students who chose to write a master’s thesis often do so because they are interested in pursuing further research, for instance in a doctoral program in marine science or another related discipline, or as a researcher in a public agency.\r\nLike a good journal article, a master’s thesis will respond to a scientific question, and will bring new evidence or arguments to bear upon the topic.\r\nHow Long Should it Be? How Long Does it Take?\r\nA master’s thesis is generally 40-80 pages, not including the bibliography. However, the length will greatly vary according to the topic and the method of analysis, so the appropriate length will be determined by you and your committee. The research project is usually developed along your two years of master. The writing of the thesis itself is usually concentrated on the last semester before the thesis defense. Some may take longer, but the thesis must be defended within four years of the beginning of your master.\r\nFinding a Topic\r\nThis is critically important. Students should think about possible topics at their application (research proposal). Keep an idea file where you jot down potential research ideas and your research project will be matured with your advisor along your fisrt semester. Be on the look out for new publications that might help provide new insights into a topic, or for past research that might be productively replicated in other circumstances.\r\nYour Advisor and Your Committee\r\nIn order to write a master’s thesis you must find a faculty member who is willing to be your thesis advisor. Faculty are not obliged to advise you but they are generally willing to do so for students who have clear ideas and who seem to have the necessary follow-through to successfully complete a thesis. Students most often wind up working with a faculty member who taught them for a course, but this is not necessarily the case.\r\nA master’s committee consists of 3-5 faculty members including your advisor. Your faculty advisor can help you assemble this committee.At least one member must be from outside our institute. Your advisor will be your chief contact while you are writing the master’s thesis, but it can be useful to stay in touch with the other members of the committee along the preparation of your thesis especially so that they are aware when you are close to completion. When you have a polished draft that is approved by your faculty advisor, you will arrange to have an oral defense of the thesis. The usual result of a defense is that the thesis is approved pending some more or less minor changes.\r\nWhen scheduling the defense, please remember to allow time for faculty members to read the thesis after you give it to them: they cannot necessarily drop everything to read a 50 page document if you give it to them only 1-2 days before the defense and to let them a minimum of two weeks to read your thesis is generally a good practice.\r\nSome other formal requirements\r\nFollow the formatting requirements for Theses and Dissertations listed on the web site of National Taiwan University Library.\r\nYou must maintain continuous enrollment while working on the master’s thesis.BREAK?\r\nBe sure to check the schedule for graduation so that you hold your oral defense in time to complete and submit your finished thesis.\r\nYou can find out more about this on the university’s Office of Academic Affairs web page: https://www.aca.ntu.edu.tw/w/acaEN/GAAD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
