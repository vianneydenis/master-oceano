Students will utilize examples from the textbook, “Writing science: How to write papers that get cited and proposals that get funded” by Joshua Schimel. I will also share comments and revisions to scientific manuscripts that I collected over the years. The class starts by having students write a short Facebook post about their own research. Students will lean to expand their Facebook post into a one-page-long (800-850 words) article. Throughout the class, students will apply writing styles and techniques to edit their article, including ways to condense their article to only 300-350 word long. Each student is also required to read and analyze four published scientific papers of their own choice: one from a specialist journal written by a leader recognized in their field and a good writer, one typical paper from a specialized journal, one review paper, and one article from Nature or Science. The course will also incorporate peer-review practices; students will learn to recognize strengths and weakness of other students’ writing and give constructive comments to help improve each other’s writing. This is exactly what scientists do routinely: we review and give constructive comments to other’s manuscripts and proposals to help the science community grow. Students who have already had writing projects (such as an abstract, manuscript, or dissertation) can also practice analyzing and editing these drafts. We will also invite a guest lecturer from NTU’s Department of Foreign Languages and Literature or from NTNU’s English Department to talk about common English mistakes made by Taiwanese students and ways to improve this.\r\nInstructor: Huei-Ting (Tina) Lin\r\nPaper Reading (OCEAN 7005) - 1 creditDescription: the class aims to establish students’ ability to read, understand, present, question, and discuss research topics by presenting a textbook chapter and scientific paper. Students are required to preparing abstracts and 35-minute presentations. We expect the presentations to go beyond the textbook contents or selected papers to acquire additional materials when necessary.\r\nInstructor: Chih-Lin WEI, Hui-Yu WANG, Chih-Hao HSIEH; Chang-Feng DAI\r\nMarine Biology and Ecology\r\nThose courses …\r\nBiological Oceanography  (OCEAN 5051) - 3 credits Description: This is a course intended for undergraduate and graduate students with knowledge of basic ecology. The focus will be on OCEANOGRAPHY, with investigation on interactive biological, chemical, and physical processes in the ocean. The purposes are to give an overview of biological ocean science (a wide rather than deep view) and to provide basic information and training for graduate research. The discussion will range from physical effects on the biology to biological effects on biogeochemical cycling; the spatial scale will range from individual organisms (e.g. viscosity and turbulences on plankton feeding and nutrient uptake) to ecosystem (e.g. remote sensing and circulation modeling); the organism will range from virus to whales.\r\nInstructor: Chih-Hao HSIEH, Fuh-Kwo SHIAH\r\nCoral Reef Ecosystem in a Changing World  (OCEAN 5097) - 3 credits Description: The rapid decline of coral reefs around the world motivates research to better understand how this complex ecosystem will respond to future environmental changes. This course will review current knowledge on reef organisms and coral reef ecosystem, and will study the factors responsible for reef degradation. The basic elements to assess resilience of this ecosystem will be introduced. The students will learn how the knowledge and skills obtained through the lectures and practice work can be used for the management and the conservation of this fragile ecosystem.\r\nInstructor: Vianney DENIS\r\nMarine Ecology (OCEAN 5002) - 3 creditsDescription: This course offers a balanced, stimulating survey of marine ecology, introducing the key processes and systems from which the marine environment is formed, and the issues and challenges surrounding its future conservation. Students are expected to develop a broad understanding of various topics of marine ecology, be able to generate an in-depth review on a selected topic and give a presentation. The presentation topic and paper should be timely and include information from current SCIENTIFIC literature related to marine ecology. Students are encouraged to participate in the discussion on both lectures and presentations.\r\nInstructor: Chih-Lin WEI\r\nDeep Sea Ecology (OCEAN 5089) - 3 creditsDescription: The vast deep sea is the largest living space on earth, and yet less than 5% of the seafloor has been explored in some details. In fact, we have better maps for the Moon, Mars, or even Venus due to our planet’s watery veil. The variety of habitats and the complex relationship with its inhabitants give rise to diverse communities, provide essential ecosystem functions and services, and maintains the ocean’s elemental cycling. However, climate changes and human activities on the seafloor have created unprecedented challenges and threats to the deep-sea ecosystems. These seemingly pristine environments have undergone major changes that out-pace our understanding of factors that drive the spatial and temporal patterns of the deep-sea ecosystems. This course will cover major topics in deep-sea ecology, including the physical environments and history, sampling techniques, adaptations of deep-sea organisms, community composition and functions, major habitats, and anthropogenic effects. By the end of this course, students are expected to be able to: 1) Describe the co-varying effects of physical environments on the adaptation of deep-sea organisms; 2) Describe the effects of depth and the co-varying factors on abundance, composition, diversity, and functions of deep-sea communities; 3) Compare and contrast various deep-sea habitats, the key processes, and associated communities; 4) Evaluate the potential impacts of human activities on the deep-sea ecosystem; 5) Read and understand scientific literature in deep-sea ecology, evaluate its findings and discuss its implications; 6) Synthesize and review a selected topic in deep-sea ecology, orally present and lead the discussion in its background, controversies, and future directions\r\nInstructor: Chih-Lin WEI\r\nField Work in Marine Biology (OCEAN 7090) - 1 creditDescription: This field course is designed for students in biological oceanography. Students will have the opportunity to participate in a 3-day research cruise onboard NTU’s R/V NOR1 to get hands-on experience on the hydrographic surveys and sampling of the planktonic and benthic communities. Students will also require to participate in hydrographic data and biological sample processing, data analysis, and complete a final report of their cruise activities.\r\nInstructor: Chih-Lin WEI, Jen-Chieh SHIAO, Chang-Feng DAI\r\nEvolutionary Biology and Population Genetics: Theory and Practice (OCEAN 5117) - 2 creditsDescription: This is a basic and practical course intended for senior undergraduate and graduate students with already strong knowledge in basic biology. Students who are interested in any fields in biology are all welcome, because all of the biological phenomena are the product of the evolution. We will learn basic but important mathematical methods for analyzing evolutionary dynamics in biological systems. The course is designed for hand-on work with the empirical data. We will also use well-developed software but we do not need skills in computer programming for our practical work.\r\nMajor topics include:\r\nBasics in evolution\r\nNeutral evolution and natural selection\r\nClassical and modern population genetics\r\nPhylogeography\r\nInstructor: Wei-Jen CHEN\r\nResearch topic on molecular systematics of fishes (OCEAN 7170) - 2 creditsDescription: The goal of systematic studies is to provide a meaningful interpretation of biodiversity and a comprehensive understating of mechanisms of evolution within the phylogenetic framework of the studying organisms. In this course, we will focus on the ray-finned fishes (especially those ones from marine habitats) that is the most diverse group of vertebrates and represents a source of valuable information for comparative biology as well as for medical science, yet many questions on their systematics (e.g., classification, taxonomy, evolution, biogeography, etc.) are still unanswered. To answer the questions, the molecular phylogenetic approach should primarily be used. The students involved in this course will learn how to use the molecular genetic data to conduct a research work for this perspective. Each student will be assigned for a work of a selected marine fish group and will be expected to write a manuscript about his/her conducted research that is publishable in a scientific journal.\r\nInstructor: Wei-Jen CHEN\r\nField Course in Coral Reef Ecology (OCEAN 7194) - 3 creditsDescription: this course is designed to provide the student with a solid foundation in ecological concepts, techniques and experimental design in field research as applied to coral reef ecosystems. It consists of a one-week field-based research at a marine research station in Taiwan. To have attended Ocean 5097 is strongly recommended before joining this course. Alternatively, solid knowledge of coral reefs and the environmental challenges they are currently facing is requested. The course will begin with a general introduction of the coral reefs and how they are influenced by global and local factors. It will quickly narrow down to the context of Taiwan by introducing the local context: known diversity, past disturbances, and on-going research. The major reef biota will be discussed in terms of their ecological requirements, roles on the reef and their overall impact. Methods in ecological monitoring and sampling will be discussed and applied on the field and will serve as a baseline for a future long-term ecological assessment. Data analysis will consist of examining and comparing structure of benthic assemblages among sites and depths (basic knowledge of R software is recommended). Students are asked to provide a poster (electronic format) summarizing their work a maximum of one month after the last day on the field.\r\nInstructor: Vianney DENIS\r\nSpecial topics on Ichthyology (OCEAN 5067) - 2 creditsDescription: This course provides advanced information on fishes.

In addition, students will broaden understanding of fisheries and natural resource management (through lectures and text book readings), practice and develop critical thinking skills (through in-class discussions and a group presentation), and learn how to read and interpret the scientific literature in fish ecology and fisheries science (through discussing the primary literature). Ultimately, this course will provide knowledge and training on formulating research questions and tackling problems in management of fisheries and other natural resources in a changing world.\r\nInstructor: Hui-Yu WANG; Yi-Jay CHANG\r\nSpecial Topic-Fisheries Stock Assessment (I) (OCEAN 5111) - 1 creditDescription: These two courses (one for each semester) were designed for graduate students to keep up to date with the latest research topics and developments in fisheries stock assessment. The course materials are mainly based on published papers in international journals. For example, papers related to fish population dynamics, stock assessment, fishery management, statistical models, and computer simulations are the primary topics of this course. Selected students give a weekly PowerPoint presentation of a paper and lead a group discussion with the professor and other students.\r\nInstructor: Yi-Jay CHANG\r\nSpecial Topic-Fisheries Stock Assessment (II) (OCEAN 5109) - 1 creditDescription: These two courses (one for each semester) were designed for graduate students to keep up to date with the latest research topics and developments in fisheries stock assessment. The course materials are mainly based on published papers in international journals. For example, papers related to fish population dynamics, stock assessment, fishery management, statistical models, and computer simulations are the primary topics of this course. Selected students give a weekly PowerPoint presentation of a paper and lead a group discussion with the professor and other students.\r\nInstructor: Yi-Jay CHANG\r\nAdvanced Quantitative Methods in Fisheries Stock Assessment (Ocean 7178) - 3 credits\r\nDescription: This course introduces advanced quantitative methods in fisheries stock assessment, including decision analysis to evaluate alternative management actions, Bayesian state-space modelling, meta-analysis, and integrated analysis. The course draws examples from real fisheries in the world and provides student broad experience with various fishery data and fish biology. The goals of this course are to train the students to be familiar with methods in fish population dynamics and stock assessment and proficient in parameter estimation, as well as the uncertainty, of an exploited fish population, and evaluation of harvest restrictions for fisheries management problems by using various computer programs and tools.\r\nInstructor: Yi-Jay CHANG\r\nMarine Data Analysis\r\nBiological modeling  (OCEAN 5074) - 3 credits Description: The course material is designed to be interdisciplinary, integrating biology, ecology, mathematics and environmental sciences. While the main course material is based on classic ecological modeling textbooks and articles, these analytic methods are applicable to multi-faceted research questions. The material builds from a single population and then extends to the ecosystem level, including species interaction, climate changes and disease as well as molecules interactions within cells. Regular modeling exercises are required (1 unit as practice). After equipped with modeling skills, students have to develop their own research questions and use modeling and data mining approaches to solve their questions. Instructors will guide students through the question-solving processes.\r\nInstructor: Chih-hao HSIEH; Hui-Yu WANG, Sheng-Feng SHEN\r\nComputer-Intensive Statistics in Ecology  (OCEAN 5052) - 3 credits Description: This is an advanced course intended for senior undergraduate and graduate students with knowledge of basic statistics including random variables, analysis of variance, regression analysis, and rank-based non-parametric statistics. We will discuss several computer-intensive statistical methods. We will discuss the theory, assumption, and application of these methods in ecological problems. The course is designed for hand-on work. Students need to get familiar with at least one computer language to do the statistics. Most of work can be done with MatLab, but any other programming language will do equally well. Sometimes, we will use well-developed software when the computation is too complicated and beyond the basic level. There will be dedicated time every week for students to present their works and to discuss the application of these methods on real world problems.\r\nInstructor: Chih-hao HSIEH; Yi-Jay CHANG\r\nEcological Modeling Seminar (Ocean 7152) - 2 credits\r\nDescription: A seminar course for presenting and discussing about research in ecology and quantitative analysis.
