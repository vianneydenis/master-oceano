Students will utilize examples from the textbook, “Writing science: How to write papers that get cited and proposals that get funded” by Joshua Schimel. I will also share comments and revisions to scientific manuscripts that I collected over the years. The class starts by having students write a short Facebook post about their own research. Students will lean to expand their Facebook post into a one-page-long (800-850 words) article. Throughout the class, students will apply writing styles and techniques to edit their article, including ways to condense their article to only 300-350 word long. Each student is also required to read and analyze four published scientific papers of their own choice: one from a specialist journal written by a leader recognized in their field and a good writer, one typical paper from a specialized journal, one review paper, and one article from Nature or Science. The course will also incorporate peer-review practices; students will learn to recognize strengths and weakness of other students’ writing and give constructive comments to help improve each other’s writing. This is exactly what scientists do routinely: we review and give constructive comments to other’s manuscripts and proposals to help the science community grow. Students who have already had writing projects (such as an abstract, manuscript, or dissertation) can also practice analyzing and editing these drafts. We will also invite a guest lecturer from NTU’s Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures or from NTNU’s English Department to talk about common English mistakes made by Taiwanese students and ways to improve this.\r\nInstructor: Huei-Ting (Tina) Lin\r\nMarine Biology and Ecology\r\nThose courses …\r\nField Course in Coral Reef Ecology (OCEAN 7194) - 3 creditsDescription: this course is designed to provide the student with a solid foundation in ecological concepts, techniques and experimental design in field research as applied to coral reef ecosystems. It consists of a one-week field-based research at a marine research station in Taiwan. To have attended Ocean 5097 is strongly recommended before joining this course. Alternatively, solid knowledge of coral reefs and the environmental challenges they are currently facing is requested. The course will begin with a general introduction of the coral reefs and how they are influenced by global and local factors. It will quickly narrow down to the context of Taiwan by introducing the local context: known diversity, past disturbances, and on-going research. The major reef biota will be discussed in terms of their ecological requirements, roles on the reef and their overall impact. Methods in ecological monitoring and sampling will be discussed and applied on the field and will serve as a baseline for a future long-term ecological assessment. Data analysis will consist of examining and comparing structure of benthic assemblages among sites and depths (basic knowledge of R software is recommended). Students are asked to provide a poster (electronic format) summarizing their work a maximum of one month after the last day on the field. Instructor: Vianney DENIS\r\nEcological Data Analysis in R (OCEAN 5089) - 3 creditsDescription: this course is designed to teach the use of a programming language for the analysis of ecological data. The course will introduce the basics of R language, and will go through topics such as data manipulation, exploration and visualization. It will then present common approaches for data analysis introducing frequent statistical tests, linear models, clustering and ordination approaches applying to multivariate data. This course mainly targets students without prior understanding of R language and who want to get familiar with this free & open-source software environment. Students will also be introduced to GitHub and Rmarkdown that further improve the use of R. Students will require a laptop for sessions. Schedule is subject to changes according to student progress. Instructor: Vianney DENIS\r\nCoral Reef Ecosystem in a Changing World (OCEAN 5097) - 3 creditsDescription: The rapid decline of coral reefs around the world motivates research to better understand how this complex ecosystem will respond to future environmental changes. This course will review current knowledge on reef organisms and coral reef ecosystem, and will study the factors responsible for reef degradation. The basic elements to assess resilience of this ecosystem will be introduced. The students will learn how the knowledge and skills obtained through the lectures and practice work can be used for the management and the conservation of this fragile ecosystem. Instructor: Vianney DENIS\r\nBiological modeling (OCEAN 5074) - 3 creditsDescription: The course material is designed to be interdisciplinary, integrating biology, ecology, mathematics and environmental sciences. While the main course material is based on classic ecological modeling textbooks and articles, these analytic methods are applicable to multi-faceted research questions. The material builds from a single population and then extends to the ecosystem level, including species interaction, climate changes and disease as well as molecules interactions within cells. Regular modeling exercises are required (1 unit as practice). After equipped with modeling skills, students have to develop their own research questions and use modeling and data mining approaches to solve their questions. Instructors will guide students through the question-solving processes. Instructor: Chih-hao HSIEH; Hui-Yu WANG\r\nComputer-Intensive Statistics in Ecology (OCEAN 5052) - 3 creditsDescription: This is an advanced course intended for senior undergraduate and graduate students with knowledge of basic statistics including random variables, analysis of variance, regression analysis, and rank-based non-parametric statistics. We will discuss several computer-intensive statistical methods. We will discuss the theory, assumption, and application of these methods in ecological problems. The course is designed for hand-on work. Students need to get familiar with at least one computer language to do the statistics. Most of work can be done with MatLab, but any other programming language will do equally well. Sometimes, we will use well-developed software when the computation is too complicated and beyond the basic level. There will be dedicated time every week for students to present their works and to discuss the application of these methods on real world problems. Instructor: Chih-hao HSIEH; Yi-Jay CHANG\r\nMarine Geology\r\nMarine Chemistry\r\nEnvironmental chemistry and sustainable management of coral reefs (field visit included) (OCEAN XXXX) - 3 creditsDescription: This advanced course is designed to train graduate students and advanced undergraduate students to obtain knowledge about environmental chemistry, focusing on coral reef environmental chemistry. The students will become skillful to channel the most updated scientific research results with citizen scientists, e.g. residential volunteers. Through this course, we will search through the literature and to identify key parameters for coral reef environmental monitoring. Students will help to analyze samples collected by our collaborating citizen scientists, to interpret the data based on literature information, and to present the results to citizen scientists at the beach site at the end of the semester.
